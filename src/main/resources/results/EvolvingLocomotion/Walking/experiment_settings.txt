Phenotype
---------
Figure with body and 2 arms. Both arms have same dimensions and connected to body with a universal joint with 2 degrees of freedom.
Body is a cube, arms are boxes.
 
With control neural network: 

Sensor layer : contact with floor, joint angels and velocities, sine wave 
Neural Net: 10 neurons -> 7 neurons. Fully connected MLP  with TanH(1.0) activation function
Output layer: Target velocity for the 2 degrees of freedom of the joints. 

Genotype
--------
Neuron to neuron weights between the 4 layers: sensor -> hidden1 -> hidden2 -> motor.
Dimensions of body cube, arms boxes.
